## Ways to Improve the Application

### Improving Accuracy:

*   **Advanced Chunking Strategies:**
    *   Implement more sophisticated chunking techniques, such as semantic chunking or sliding window approaches, to better capture context.
    *   Vary the chunk size and overlap depending on the type of document and LLM capabilities.
*   **Metadata Integration:**
    *   Integrate document metadata such as section headings, table titles, etc., into the embedding process to provide more contextual information. 
    *   I currently add section heading, but more metadata can be added.
*   **Query Expansion/Rewriting:**
    *   We can change the questions or queries to make it more natural for better semantic matching.
*   **Fine-tuning Embedding Models:**
    *   Fine-tune embedding models on domain-specific data or question-answer pairs relevant to the type of documents being processed.
*   **Context Window Optimization:**
    *   Dynamically adjust the amount of context passed to the LLM based on the complexity of the question and the available context window.

*   **Handling Tables and Images:**
    *   Integrate OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for extracting text from images within the PDF.
    *   Develop specific strategies for processing and understanding tabular data within the document.
*   **Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Experiment with different prompt structures and instructions to guide the LLM towards more accurate and relevant answers.
*   **Reranking with More Sophisticated Models:**
    *   Explore more advanced reranking models or techniques beyond basic cross-encoders.

### Improving Modularity, Scalability, and Production Readiness:

*   **Decoupled Components with Interfaces:**
    *   Define interfaces for each component (e.g., `DocumentLoader`, `Embedder`, `LLM`, `VectorDB`). This makes it easier to swap out implementations without affecting other parts of the system.
*   **Microservices Architecture:**
    *   Decompose the application into smaller, independent microservices such as a service for document processing, one for embedding, and one for querying. This helps in scalability and maintainability.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:**
    *   Long-running operations like PDF processing and embedding are done using asynchronous tasks to enhance responsiveness.
*   **Containerization (Docker)**:
    *   Package the application and its dependencies in Docker containers so deployment is uniform across environments.
*   **Orchestration (Kubernetes):**
    *   Use Kubernetes to manage and scale containerized services
*   **Centralised Configuration Management:**
    *   Employ a centralized configuration service like HashiCorp Consul, etcd, to manage application settings and secrets.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Elasticsearch to monitor performance and identify issues.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   Expose the application's functionality through well-defined API endpoints (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) for integration with other systems.
*   **Caching Mechanisms**:
    *   Cache frequently accessed data, such as embeddings and processed chunks, to speed up processing and lighten the load on downstream services.
*   **Rate Limiting and Authentication:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and authentication to protect the API and manage usage.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Establish a CI/CD pipeline for auto-building, testing, and deployment of the application.
*   **Database for Persistent Storage:** 
    * Use a database to store the processed documents, embeddings, etc., for persistence and efficient retrieval. Vector databases are good choices for optimized storage and querying of embeddings.
*   **Error Handling and Resilience:**
    *   Implement comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and circuit breakers to make the application more resilient to failures.
*   **Security Best Practices:**
    *   Follow security best practices, including secure storage of API keys, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
